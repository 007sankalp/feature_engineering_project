## Feature_Engineering
Welcome to the Feature Engineering project. In this project, we will do hands-on method to set our expertise in whatever we have learned
so far in feature engineering course. 

**In all above procedures we have used cleaned data or Pre-processed data.**

**Real-life data contains missing values, have ouliers, and less optimized.**

What we have learned in class so far is listed below:
* `Missing Value` - finding out the missing value from the dataset and Imputation of missing value
* `Outlier` - Outlier detection and methods to deal with outlier detection
* `Skewness` - Skewness treatment using transformation methods
* `Encoding` - Encoding of categorical data.

## Dataset
In this assignment you will be having dataset which we have seen from last couple of sessions i.e. `IOWA dataset(NY Housing data)`.

As we all know that this dataset contains 81 variables related to houses listed in NY and their `SalePrice`. 
You will be given subset of this dataset to perform the few task and raw(original) dataset for few task.
This will give you an idea about how techniques are related or can affect other techniques.

## Why this assignment?

* This assignment will help you to get familiar with primary and important steps of Pre-Processing and cleaning of dataset.
* We will learn why use specific techniques over other technique.
* For this assignment you will be given following python packages for use in creating functions:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - sklearn
    - scipy
  
By completing this project you will be awarded with 250 points.

So why wait, Let's get started!
